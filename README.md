The are my responses to the questions contained in the task 3:
I made use of YOLOv8.
Yes  CPU and GPU were critical in my choice. YOLO detects an object in 6s with CPU but lesser on GPU.
No. My approach remains the same. This is because YOLO is able to detect objects it have been trained on both in video mp4 or images.
